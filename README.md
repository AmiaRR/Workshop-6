# Workshop-6 

https://amiarr.github.io/Workshop-6/

For this task I created a random poem generator using the RiTa.js library. Unfortunantly the webpage and the VScode sketch appear different, as evidenced by the screenshot of the VSCode. I also tried using some of the functions from the RiTa.js library using the help of ChatGPT, RiTa.randomWord() was successful, though I don't think RiTa.isAdjective() and RiTa.syllables() were very successful. I could of donw a better job of this task but trying out more and experimenting with functions from the RiTa.js library.
