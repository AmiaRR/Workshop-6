# Workshop-6 

https://amiarr.github.io/Workshop-6/

For this task I created a random poem generator using the RiTa.js library. Unfortunantly the webpage and the VScode sketch appear different, as evidenced by the screenshot of the VSCode. In my first attempt of this task by following the video tutorial I was able to make a text box, but my words were not appearing on the canvas or rhyming, so I used ChatGPT to help resolve this, though it still didn't work in the webpage. I also tried using some of the functions from the RiTa.js library, RiTa.randomWord() was successful, though I don't think RiTa.isAdjective() and RiTa.syllables() ended up working. I could of done a better job of this task but trying out more and experimenting with functions from the RiTa.js library.
